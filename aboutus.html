          <p>Anyone that remembers a good teacher will know that actors make great teachers and teachers can be great actors.
            The Acting Solution team are both. Experienced actors and educators alike we are perfectly suited to guide your
            students through drama activity based training.
          </p>
          <p>Due to the versatility and limitless scope acting offers we are able to offer a wide spectrum of training programs.
            We can deliver elementary communication workshops to encourage English usage of entry level employees up to heavily
            involved role play scenarios with trained actors and higher management. We listen to your needs first and use the
            right tools to help you find the best solution.
          </p>
          <p>We have over 10 yearsâ€™ experience in training language skills and acting skills. But it is only now that we
            are combining them to give a truly unique and effective learning experience.
